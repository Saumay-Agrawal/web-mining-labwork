new delhi: a year ago, prime minister narendra modi announced the scrapping of high-value banknotes which amounted to 86% of currency in circulation. the demonetisation of currency notes was supposed to be an attack on black money, on counterfeit notes, and projected as part of a broader push to promote digitization and non-cash payments. a year later, progress on all these counts appears to be very modest, and should make us question whether this exercise was needed at all to fulfil its stated aims.the costs imposed by the currency-scrapping exercise were, however, quite severe, at least in the short term, disrupting ordinary life across the country for several weeks. the hardest-hit were those in rural areas, where access to banking and the internet are quite low. a 2016 reserve bank of india (rbi) report on branch authorization policy classified 93% of rural centres in the country as unbanked, with the population dependent on roving banking correspondents and on distant urban or semi-urban branches. access to the internet is equally patchy, with only 3% of households in underdeveloped rural areas reporting access to internet in a 2016 consumer economy survey.click here for enlarge if(isdeviceenabled('small')) { var googletag = googletag || {};
